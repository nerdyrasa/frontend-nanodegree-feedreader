# Udacity FEND Project 6
 
Use Jasmine to test an existing application.

## What is Jasmine?

From [Jasmine documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/):
>Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

  
## How to run this application
  
1. Clone the project.
2. Open index.html in a browser.
3. View the results of the tests by scrolling to the bottom of the browser window.
